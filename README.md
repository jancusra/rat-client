# Rat React client application
### [ NOT MAINTAINED CODE (ONLY FOR DEMONSTRATION) ]

[Here is server API for this application](https://github.com/jancusra/rat-server)

* Public web and administration layout
* Multi-language support
* Common forms and controls with a validation
* Users and roles management
* Table of logged events
* Super fast administration view definition
* Optimized distribution with report page
* Without the React Redux - it's overkill here
